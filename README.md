Unity Banana Navigation
==================================

![banana](images/banana.gif)

This project aims to solve unity banana navigation environment (see `Environment Details`) using Deep Reinforcement Learning. 

## Environment Details

An agent should learn to navigate (and collect bananas!) in a large, square world. A reward of +1 is provided for collecting a yellow banana, and a reward of -1 is provided for collecting a blue banana. Thus, the goal of the agent is to collect as many yellow bananas as possible while avoiding blue bananas.

The state space has 37 dimensions and contains the agent's velocity, along with ray-based perception of objects around agent's forward direction. Given this information, the agent has to learn how to best select actions. Four discrete actions are available, corresponding to:

0 - move forward.
1 - move backward.
2 - turn left.
3 - turn right.

The task is episodic, and in order to solve the environment, the agent must get an average score of +13 over 100 consecutive episodes.


## Requirements

- Python 3.5 or higher ([Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download/#macos))
- [NumPy](http://www.numpy.org/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) 
- [UnityAgents](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/ml-agents)
- [OpenAI Gym](https://gym.openai.com/)
- [The Banana Collector Environment](https://github.com/ucaiado/banana-rl/blob/master/drlnd/README.md)

## Run

Run the following command on the terminal; doing so will pop up a window on your default browser which you can then use to explore the `Solution.ipynb` file to learn how to train the agent and run the code.

```shell
$ jupyter notebook
```
